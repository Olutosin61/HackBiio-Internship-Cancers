**BRCA**

Tumor suppressor genes, such as the BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility gene), generate proteins that preserve genomic stability by fixing broken DNA. This gene is essential for the prevention of cancer because it repairs DNA damage that can result in cancer and controls the growth of tumors that grow out of control. Breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are found on chromosomes 17 and 13, respectively, are the most researched BRCA genes<!--[if supportFields]><span

Via the process of accurate DNA repair by homologous recombination, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are essential for the preservation of genomic integrity. When mutated, it has been discovered that they increase an individual's risk of acquiring cancer.&#x20;

 

**BRCA MUTATIONS**

BRCA mutations happen when changes are made to the DNA that codes for the gene, making it unable to function correctly. These mutations cause this gene to fail and become less efficient at repairing DNA damage sustained during subsequent cell cycles, which usually leads to apoptosis (cell death). The loss of BRCA functions leads to genomic instability, which in turn causes non-tumorigenic cells to undergo oncogenic transformation into cancer stem cells (CSCs), which in turn causes tumor progression.<!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>

Regardless of gender, every offspring of a genetic carrier bears a 50% risk of acquiring the mutant gene from the parent who also contains the mutation.<!--[if supportFields]><span

The majority of lesions in the BRCA1 gene are caused by frameshift insertions and deletions, non-synonymous truncations, and splicing site disruptions, which can result in missense mutations or the production of non-functional proteins. Generally speaking, mutations in the BRCA1 gene predispose people to several cancer forms, including prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer in men and women. Furthermore, bearers of the BRCA1 mutation may be more susceptible to developing colon, rectal, or pancreatic cancers.<!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span

Frameshift insertions, deletions, and nonsense mutations are the most common lesions in the BRCA2 gene, and they cause premature truncation or non-functional proteins. Mutations in the BRCA2 gene predispose to malignant cutaneous and ocular melanoma, pancreatic, gall bladder, bile duct, and stomach cancer in addition to breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer.<!--[if supportFields]><span

**CONCLUSION**

Early detection of BRCA mutation-related cancers can improve treatment outcomes. It has been demonstrated that preventive surgery and mastectomy are helpful in lowering the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, among other cancers.
